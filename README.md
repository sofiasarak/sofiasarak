<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Sofia Sarak</h1>

I'm currenly an environmental data science Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. My coursework includes applications of R, Python, SQL, and other data science techniques to environmental issues. Some examples of I'm learning include geospatial analysis, data visualization, and machine learning!

### Past Experiences

I studied Earth & Environmental Sciences and Economics at Wesleyan University for undergrad, and have experience with urban water quality monitoring, morphometric analysis for evolutionary biology, and trophic level designation via isotopes. I have also studied on the Galapagos Islands and New Zealand (I love islands!), which were *incredible* experiences that I bring into my daily life.
