<h1 align="center">Hello! ☀️ I'm Sofia Sarak...</h1>

...And I'm currenly an environmental data science Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management!

My coursework includes applications of R, Python, SQL, and other data science techniques to environmental issues. Some examples of what I'm learning include geospatial analysis, data visualization, and machine learning! Check out my projects and assignments in my pinned respositories :)

### Past Experiences 

I studied Earth & Environmental Sciences 🌱🌋 and Economics 📈 at Wesleyan University for undergrad, and have worked in urban water quality monitoring, morphometric analysis for evolutionary biology, and trophic level designation via isotopes. I have also studied on the Galapagos Islands and New Zealand (I love islands!), which were *incredible* experiences that I bring into my daily life.
