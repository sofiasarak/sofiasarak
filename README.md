<h1 align="center">Hello! ☀️ I'm Sofia Sarak...</h1>

...And I'm currenly an environmental data science Master's student at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.

My coursework primarly includes applications of R and Python, using data science techniques to investigate environmental issues. Some examples of what I'm learning include geospatial analysis, data visualization, and machine learning. Check out my projects and assignments in my pinned respositories!

### Hopes and Dreams 💭
I'm looking to apply my data analysis and management skills to projects rooted in societal improvement, whether it be by increasing accessibility through data visualization, conducting research to inform regulations and policies, or supporting conservation efforts or the maintenance public green spaces.

### Past Experiences 🗺️

I studied Earth & Environmental Sciences 🌱🌋 and Economics 📈 at Wesleyan University for undergrad, and have worked in urban water quality monitoring, morphometric analysis for evolutionary biology, and trophic level designation via isotopes. I have also studied on the Galapagos Islands and New Zealand (I love islands!), which were *incredible* experiences that I bring into my daily life.

### Fun Facts 🌠
🏡 I am originally from southern Connecticut, and am hoping to move back to the East Coast (or potentially the Midwest) after graduation. I love seasons!

🌍 My parents are immigrants from Eastern Europe, so I grew up speaking Russian and Ukrainian and eating borscht every winter. 

📚 When I was a kid, I spent all my time with my nose in a book and hoping to be an author one day. Now, data science helps me fulfill my storytelling dreams!
